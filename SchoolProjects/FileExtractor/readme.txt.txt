This is a program that parses out jji the files using the header and footer JOSH JONES.
In order to run the file compile it using any C compiler and then run it and have the file you want to parse as an argument.
Let the program run and the files will appear in the directory of project2.cc.

To be specific the header and footer that project 2 finds in this the raw data is "J O S H" and "J O N E S" where an empty space is in between each letter.

This program should find 540 jji files.
